  SPOTIFY CREDENTIALS SETUP GUIDE
========================================

The app is now running and you can test the UI!
However, to get music recommendations, you need Spotify credentials.

QUICK SETUP (5 minutes):

1. Go to: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

2. Log in with your Spotify account (free or premium both work)

3. Click "Create App" button

4. Fill in the form:
   - App Name: Emotion Music Player (or any name)
   - App Description: Music recommendation based on emotions
   - Website: http://localhost:5001
   - Redirect URI: http://localhost:5001/callback (optional)
   - Check the agreement checkbox
   - Click "Save"

5. After creating the app, you'll see:
   - Client ID: Click to copy
   - Client Secret: Click "View client secret" and copy

6. Create a file named ".env" in the project folder with this content:

   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=paste_your_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=paste_your_client_secret_here

7. Replace "paste_your_client_id_here" and "paste_your_client_secret_here" 
   with your actual credentials from step 5.

8. Save the .env file

9. Restart the Flask server (stop and run "python app.py" again)

10. Now try detecting emotion - you should get real Spotify song recommendations!

========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
========================================

- Make sure .env file is in the same folder as app.py
- Make sure there are no spaces around the = sign
- Make sure you copied the full Client ID and Secret
- After updating .env, restart the Flask server
